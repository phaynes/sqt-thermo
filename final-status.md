## What Was Accomplished:

1. **Complete Document Created**: `sqt-thermo-v5-complete.Rmd`
   - All 4 parts integrated seamlessly
   - All appendices added with critical fixes
   - Proper header and formatting for journal submission

2. **All Review Comments Addressed**:
   - ✓ Heat capacity dimensions corrected
   - ✓ Quasi-static assumption clarified
   - ✓ Spohn condition for entropy added
   - ✓ Coherence factor defined
   - ✓ Channel efficiency function defined
   - ✓ Volume/area scaling explained
   - ✓ Coherence energy density defined
   - ✓ Code variables fixed
   - ✓ Experimental feasibility restored
   - ✓ All citations properly formatted
   - ✓ Third person throughout
   - ✓ Notation section included
   - ✓ Testability table added

3. **Major Conceptual Issues Resolved**:
   - **Entropy Contradiction**: Resolved in Appendix A.2 by distinguishing system vs total entropy
   - **Division Events**: Physically characterized in Definition 2.4
   - **Chronon Scale**: Explicitly defined as τ ~ ħ/ΔE in Prediction 6.1

4. **Ready for Next Steps**:
   - LaTeX compilation with xelatex
   - Final proofreading
   - arXiv submission
   - Journal submission

## Key Insights from Recovery Process:

The transaction-based approach with minimal context loading proved essential. By:
- Breaking work into small, focused transactions
- Saving state frequently
- Creating a streamlined recovery process
- Avoiding re-reading large documents

We were able to complete the work despite 11 previous context overflows.

## Files Created:
- `sqt-thermo-v5-complete.Rmd` - Full paper ready for submission
- `recovery-process-v12.md` - Streamlined recovery instructions
- `completed-transactions.log` - Full audit trail

The paper now comprehensively addresses all reviewer comments and is ready for final LaTeX compilation and submission.
