  This paper presents a comprehensive reformulation of thermodynamics, information theory, and spacetime dynamics within the Stochastic-Quantum Theorem (SQT) framework developed by Barandes. By representing thermodynamic processes as generalized stochastic systems (GSS) and exploiting their quantum embedding, the complete formulations of all four laws of thermodynamics are derived that explicitly incorporate quantum coherence effects. The framework establishes rigorous connections between Shannon information theory and quantum information, deriving new bounds on information processing and thermodynamic resources. It is proposed that spacetime geometry may emerge from the entropic dynamics of division events in the SQT framework, suggesting a possible unification of gravity and quantum mechanics through stochastic indivisibility. The paper predicts specific experimental signatures including quantum corrections to heat capacity of order $\hbar^2\langle(\nabla V)^2\rangle/(12mk_BT^2\tau^2)$, modifications to the Jarzynski equality, and potential tests of discrete spacetime at the Planck scale. Numerical simulations demonstrate the evolution of stochastic versus quantum entropy, revealing how coherence serves as a thermodynamic resource between division events.

# Introduction

The unification of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, information theory, and gravity remains one of the deepest challenges in theoretical physics. The Stochastic-Quantum Theorem (SQT) developed by Barandes [1,2] provides a framework that reveals quantum mechanics as emergent from more fundamental stochastic processes. This paper exploits this correspondence to develop a unified framework encompassing:

1. **Thermodynamics**: How all four laws of thermodynamics emerge from and are modified by the stochastic-quantum correspondence
2. **Information Theory**: The fundamental connection between Shannon and von Neumann information within SQT
3. **Spacetime Dynamics**: How entropy production through division events may drive the creation and evolution of spacetime
4. **Experimental Predictions**: Concrete, testable consequences distinguishing SQT from standard quantum theory

## Key Contributions

The main results include:

- **Complete SQT Thermodynamics**: Formulation of all four laws within the SQT framework, including quantum coherence effects
- **SQT Gibbs Equation**: Modified thermodynamic relations including coherence work terms
- **Information-Thermodynamic Duality**: Rigorous bounds connecting information processing to thermodynamic cost
- **Emergent Spacetime Hypothesis**: A mechanism for spacetime creation through entropic division events
- **Experimental Signatures**: Specific predictions for quantum thermodynamic experiments and cosmological observations

## Notation and Units

Throughout this paper, natural units are employed where $\hbar = c = 1$ unless otherwise specified. When dimensional analysis is required, these constants are restored explicitly. Boltzmann's constant $k_B$ is retained to track thermodynamic scales. Temperature $T$ is always absolute temperature in Kelvin. The inverse temperature $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ appears frequently in statistical mechanical expressions.

# The Stochastic-Quantum Framework

## Generalized Stochastic Systems

Following Barandes [1], a generalized stochastic system is defined as:

**Definition 2.1** (Generalized Stochastic System). A GSS is a tuple $(C, T, \Gamma, p, \mathcal{A})$ where:
- $C = \{1, 2, ..., N\}$: finite configuration space
- $T \subseteq \mathbb{R}$: time set with $0 \in T$
- $\Gamma: C^2 \times T \rightarrow [0,1]$: stochastic map with $\Gamma_{ij}(t) = p(i,t|j,0)$
- $p: C \times T \rightarrow [0,1]$: probability distribution
- $\mathcal{A}$: algebra of observables

satisfying normalization $\sum_i \Gamma_{ij}(t) = 1$ and evolution $p_i(t) = \sum_j \Gamma_{ij}(t)p_j(0)$.
